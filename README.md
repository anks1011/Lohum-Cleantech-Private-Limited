To create the RESTful API that returns the price mentioned on the webpage provided, we can use the Flask framework in Python. Here are the steps to create the API:

Install Flask and the required libraries. We will use the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the webpage and get the price.

1)Run the Flask app:
python main.py

2)Test the API by making a GET request to http://localhost:5000/price.
